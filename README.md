# Week_2_Assignment
Lists operations
This repository contains a Python script (list_operations.py) for an assignment focused on fundamental list operations. The code walks through how to manipulate a list by adding, removing, and sorting its elements, covering the basics from start to finish.
The script performs the following sequence of operations on a single list:

Initializes an empty list.

Appends multiple elements (10, 20, 30, 40).

Inserts an element (15) at a specific position.

Extends the list with another list ([50, 60, 70]).

Removes the last element.

Sorts the list in ascending order.

Finds and prints the index of a specific value (30).
How to Run the Code

To run this script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Save the code from list_operations.py to a file on your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the script using the following command:

Bash
python list_operations.py
Expected Final Output

After all operations are completed, the script should print the final state of the list and the index of the value 30.

List after appending: [10, 20, 30, 40]
List after inserting 15: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
List after extending: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
List after removing the last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
List after sorting: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
The index of the value 30 is: 3
